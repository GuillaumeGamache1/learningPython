Hi, I'm Guillaume,

I ventured into learning Python to actualize two app ideas and broaden my career prospects. 
Initially, I tried online tutorials, but felt disengaged watching others code. My research on learning how to code made me realize
that my learning should emphasize hands-on coding, so I shifted my focus to project-based learning, all in Python.

With ChatGPT's assistance, I curated a list of 50 projects. I made sure ChatGPT only advised and didn't code for me, unless I 
needed syntax reminders or post-project optimization insights.

Here are the 50 projects:
